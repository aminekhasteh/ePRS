# Association Of Whole-Person Eigen-PRSs with Alzherimer's Disease

As part of my Master's thesis at Dalla Lana School of Public Health I worked of generating over 2000 Polygenic Risk Scores (PRSs). We harnessed the recent GWAS summary statistics from the [Pan UKBB](http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank) consortium, and produced over 120,000 PRSs on the Religious Order Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) study cohort. Please check out the first draft of our research work at [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.13.507735v2.abstract).
